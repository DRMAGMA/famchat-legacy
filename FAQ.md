## Question: Can't load fallbacklist because the file: SeedlessFallbackList.txt don't exits

## Answer

In latest versions, this error doesn't occur. 

In previous versions:

Put https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypnosis-i2p/i2pqtchat/master/SeedlessFallbackList.txt 
file into your I2P Messenger application folder, see below. After that, close the I2P Messenger application and re-launch.

 * If you built under Qt Creator, this folder will be `../build*`.
